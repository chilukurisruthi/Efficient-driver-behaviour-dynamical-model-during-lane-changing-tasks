# Efficient-driver-behaviour-dynamical-model-during-lane-changing-tasks
This work introduces an efficient driver behaviour dynamical model designed to simulate lane-changing tasks in a realistic and computationally feasible manner.demonstrating potential applications in autonomous vehicle testing, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and traffic simulation platforms.
